	<h4 style="font-variant:titling-caps;font-style:oblique;font-weight:150px;">Childhood  Years</h2>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My family and used to live in an apartment in Ibingay, Masbate City. <sup>1</sup> My mother is a government employee,
	while my father is a former seaman which he is quite strict and both of my parents are working very hard for our future. <sup>2</sup> I have childhood friend named Danica which
	I call ate Danica and Bryan which is the same age as me. We played a lot in the backyard and have a lot of time spending each others tim by playing with smiles printed on our faces. <sup>3</sup>
	My older sister named Nikki and I were the ones who played with them since little and they were our closest friend in our street since both of my ate and I are very shy and can't 
	easily approach someone that we are not familiar with. <sup>4</sup> Also this is where I started my journey in Liceo de Masbate. <sup>5</sup> A school where I considered the type of my "second" biggest everything. <sup>5</sup>
	Starting from the teachers is my second parents whom I really appreciate where we were really stubborn kids, they were not the strictest person that I ever knew. <sup>6</sup>
	They were really supportive and really showed the transparent and affectionate way of taking care with us and kept on teaching us despite our behaviors. <sup>7</sup> My classmates which is
	my second sisters and brothers that I deeply care about they were the ones whom I adored my childhod memories. <sup>8</sup> Event though it was such a short period of time,
	they were embedded deep in my heart because through them I was able to discover a lot of things. <sup>9</sup> I was able to be myself just like any other kid would do. <sup>10</sup>
	I experienced dancing with my former classmates for the very first time when I was on Kinder, we were wearing frog suits and the song named crazy frog by axel F which we
	really the song due to it is very pop and has different sounds which amazed us, I danced with them and have a great time with the guidance of our teachers. <sup>11</sup>
	play well with the children by variety of child games like B-I-N-G-O, luksong baka, patintero, agawan base and many more, being tripped by running, being messy 
	while eating, having petty fights, but most of all having memories that are remained a pure memory where I can just do nothing but reminiscene the genuine and happiest 
	moments that I experienced and felt which I really treasured until now. <sup>12</sup> When weekends came, I personally played with my older sister or younger brother. <sup>13</sup>
	We played bahay-bahayan, jack stones, cooking with the materials ofthe leaves and rock. <sup>14</sup> If playing alone, I would play with the stuff toys not the barbie dolls or baby
	dolls because they freaked me out somtimes, I really don't like them even my older sisters. <sup>15</sup> It is making me scared to think that they are going to talk and walk on their 
	own, I really don't like their eyes because it made me feel that they would blink or wink at me. <sup>16</sup> I also prefer to play online games in my laptop which is in Facebook before,
	I was really into playing games when I was young, it was very addicting for me. <sup>17</sup> I also had darker complexion and was really skinny. <sup>18</sup> I had tons of photos that 
	showed my face which was not really pretty for me because I look so weird in the photos. <sup>18</sup> I uploaded the photos privately in my former Facebook account before it was hacked. <sup>19</sup>
	Even though I was so young back then I really enjoyed my memories of being a child and wished to be a child again because you will just cry over petty reasons and ended up standing again,
	Being a child means a lot to me, it was really precious just like a family whom you will remember and treasured until your last breath of life.<sup>20</sup>

	<h3 style="font-variant:small-caps;font-style:helvetica;font-weight;200px">Teenage Years</h2>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where I started to realize and discover the things or scenarios that I weren't aware of in my entire life. <sup>1</sup> 
		Since I am just starting up and being able to develop myself more in terms of learning capacity, physical and mental enhancement, being able to progress in various types of physical actvities or
		even analytic or critical thinking, I was bound to have bigger and countless responsibilities as I grew up. <sup>2</sup> My father stopped working due to he was diagnosed with problems in his spinal
		cord, which he ended up retiring while I was on my 7th grade. <sup>3</sup> We moved to our new house in Nursery, Masbate City because my mother and father started their own house which we would not
		pay for the monthly expense for the apartment anymore. We we're also quite happy since it was bigger and more comfortable since we have our own house now. <sup>4</sup> I was able to have awards and medals since
		I was elementary and really made my family happy though I was not able to make it before I entered senior high, I have obtain the with honors award throughout the two years of senior high when I was with my mother 
		to acquire the medal, my mother was purely showing his expression of being happy and proud which I thought that all my efforts were paid by all those sleepless nights, non-stop quizzes and acitivities
		that came by, I became once was proud of myself for the first time. <sup>5</sup> It was like one of my achievements because I have seen my mother with her brightest smile showing how proud she is. <sup>3</sup> It made
		me very enthusiastic of entering my college life so I could wear the loose outer garment which is popular known as toga and marching towards another phase of life. <sup>6</sup> Making my family all proud with my achievements. <sup>7</sup>
		Making me say it was all worth it. <sup>8</sup> Even though I am having thoughts of maturing, I still played with my friends, we we're still young after all. I also started being a fan girl of kpop including kpop girl and boy groups,
		learning korean dances and even watching k-drama which I find entertaining. <sup>9</sup> I have also started making my hobby as reading e-books in my digital phone, learning different fictional or even romantic
		stories, I really have read a lot which made me more involve in constructing correct words and sentences. <sup>10</sup> While learning in school, I also learned the way of making proper words to write if we have 
		activities such as essay which made me a lot easier to think throughly in a short time. <sup>11</sup> My classmates and I continue to participate in every curricular activities in the school, I participated mostly
		in interpretative dance and dance competition, everything that is related to dance. We were mostly on top when announcing the winners and sometimes obtaining the 1st place throughout middle grade level that we are participating.
		<sup>12</sup> I was not the extrovert type of person, it made me very difficult even for the former classmates that I knew for a long time, the closeness is not just enough. <sup>13</sup> I am not the friendly type because it made me feel suffocated
		when I am with many people and unable to talk comfotably in my own way. <sup>14</sup> I was too afraid and shy at the same time. <sup>15</sup> But even though it was quite difficult, I still made friends to someone who are more 
		approachable with their friendly smiles and action towards me. They we're really true to themselves and shows no fake attitude. It made me really mature and think of I don't need to be friends with anyone as I have ones that made me
		more on the good side rather than the stubborn and rebel type. They we're the perfect friends that we are very much suitable to each other. <sup>16</sup> In our school Liceo de Masbate, if we have special celeberation such as the birthday
		of Immaculate Conception, we would always start our day by attending the mass. <sup>17</sup> Even if it is the first friday of the month, we would attend the mass and continue the classes later. <sup>18</sup>In our foundation, we would really enjoy a lot since
		it is a three day celebration with a lot of events such as game competition that can be awarded to those who will be runner ups and 1st place prizes. <sup>19</sup> Enjoying middle school was like a ferris wheel, there were ups and downs that made me experienced
		being sad, regretful, cried and felicitous over numerous reasons but made me who I am right now. <sup>20</sup> I am proud to graduate and joyful to be able to experience what a high school life wheras some people cannot attend school, I was one those people
		who were able to feel lucky and blessed.

	<h2 style="font-variant:all-small-caps;font-style:helvetica;font-weight;400px">College Years</h2>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; College life have been a tough and exciting road for me as I continue to walk through it. <sup>1</sup> At first I was very overwhelmed and nervous as I entered the UE Manila for I have registered to do CET and thinking that I would fail again. <sup>2</sup>
		I did two college entrance test but in the end I failed to be accepted because I was below quota that did not end well making me doubt about myself if I can really do it. <sup>3</sup> I prayed for nights and even before the exam, murmuring that I could do this with God's guidance, the test results stated that I've passed 
		and made me really happy. <sup>4</sup> I was on the bench praying and thanking God for giving me a chance to passed. <sup>5</sup> It really made my day to encourage myself more and overcome what I can do more to achieve anything that is possible to do. <sup>6</sup>I was really anxious on my very first day. <sup>7</sup>
		My older sister named Nikki was the one who were there to go with me outside the school.<sup>8</sup> As I enter the school, I immediately saw the students going to their respective classrooms and having some small talks with their friends. <sup>9</sup> Even before I enter the classroom I already met with someone named Joann and Joshua who were close friends and they attend
		the same school in shs. <sup>10</sup>Through them I was able to have a lot friends who are really helpful and friendly, they were a big part of my college years that I would not dare to forget. <sup>11</sup> We have our group who keeps supporting and giving cheeful vibes to lighten up our day and bonding with them more.<sup>12</sup>My friends are 
		eating very well which I was influenced in a good way because I am skinny and made me more energized to eat more than usual. <sup>13</sup>Even when we go to the mall or have some time outside we were very involved in terms of eating delicious food. <sup>14</sup> I was quite having difficulty of commuting because it all public transportation 
		was always occupied especially on Monday because it was always hectic and I'm usually late in my first class but I'm very grateful because the professors were always kind and considerate. <sup>15</sup> I was also kinda homesick since I'm away from my family and after I arrived from our apartment, it was very quite and solace 
		which also give me comfort at times when I'm alone. <sup>16</sup> I was able to clean the apartment every week, able to cook myself when lunch or dinner came, in small ways I was being independent and knowing things more, adjusting bit by bit and being more careful and conscious in my surroundings.<sup>17</sup> It made me
		to realize that I should step myself up. <sup>18</sup> When pandemic welcome all over the world, we also stop and cancelled the face to face classes and started having virtual classes for the very first time, it was like having a new dimension that I've never entered before. <sup>19</sup>This whole journey of college goes to being successful 
		in life that I have to endure and learn in any types of road that I will pave. <sup>20</sup> For now, I will continue to learn and discover great things that would lead me to a bigger understanding in life and having valuable qualities as person who still continue to live despite some difficulties in life, no hurdles can stop even a storm that
		I would encounter, I will overcome anything with the guidance of God and the support from my family.
